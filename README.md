# Advanced Notes

This is an advanced note taking application that supports markdown and categories, as well as enables searching and filtering of the notes.

The application has been made by following a tutorial by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j898RGRw0b4&list=PLrWfclKvIy9sUKItoZ_gCzrfp2eMs-rui&index=28). The purpose of this project was therefore personal education. It features advanced React and TypeScript methodologies, and served to bolster my understanding of both.

If you want to initialise and play around with the code yourself, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine and install the dependencies using the NPM package manager. Then start the development server and navigate to your open localhost port.

    npm install
    npm run dev
